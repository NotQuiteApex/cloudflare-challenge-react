# Frontend to my Cloudflare worker
Built as the second part of my Cloudflare application challenge. React was not
something I had used before, but it's component-based system was a lot of fun
to mess with! The most trouble I had was with testing, as CORS policies are
annoying overhead. Second most troubling thing I had to deal with was getting
the REST requests working correctly, as they operate asynchronously. This isn't
a bad thing, I just had to think a bit more about where certain functions/lambdas
would go.
